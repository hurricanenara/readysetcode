## Regex

### Alternation
Do you love baboons and gorillas? You can find either of them with the same regular expression using alternation! Alternation, performed in regular expressions with the pipe symbol, |, allows us to match either the characters preceding the | OR the characters after the |. The regex baboons|gorillas will match baboons in the text I love baboons, but will also match gorillas in the text I love gorillas.
