# readysetcode

### Description
readySetCode is where I push most of my newfound knowledge to.
So far I've been learning these languages and frameworks & libraries specific to each language:
* JavaScript - React, React Native, GSAP, d3.js, Express.js, Socket.io
* TypeScript
* Python - Pandas, NumPy
* Ruby - Ruby on Rails
* Java
* C++

I've also been enjoying using advanced CSS to bring life to SVGs.

I am excitedly anticipating to learn more about Java and new languages like Swift, Kotlin, and Go.
